Hello, my name is Vincent Morrison and I'm a software engineer living in St. Louis.  I have always had a passion for designing systems and
processes, having gone to college for chemistry and spending the last five years building and designing labs for startups.  I found that there
was often a need for custom software for custom labs, and as budget startups, I looked into alternatives.  After some research and basic lessons,
I discovered making tools and getting them hosted was not as huge a task as I feared, and I got to work.  After a few years of simple projects,
I was ready for more and have been a freelance web developer full-time for the last six months.
